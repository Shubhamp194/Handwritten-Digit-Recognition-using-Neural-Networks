# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-Neural-Networks
A hand written digit recognition model is created using MNIST dataset. It is then used to predict digits entered through mouse in real time.
1. Please follow the following steps :-


   1.1 - To run the code you are required to install the following software first - 
      1.Python
      2.Jupyter Notebook
      3.Anaconda (if required)

   1.2 - You also need the following libraries - 
      1.Matplotlib
      2.Tensorflow
      3.Numpy
      4.Keras
      5.OpenCV
      6.Pygame

   2. he code is divided into different directories according to its functioning
      2.1 - Code to create model - This has the code that will create a model and will save it in the Models directory
      2.2 - Code to test the models - This directory again contains two directories - 
         2.2.1 - Code to run live input test - This contains code written with the help of Python's Pygame library to take live input through a pointing device
                 for example  mouse input and make predictions at the same time. 
         2.2.2 - Code to test through saved images - This contains code to make predictions on images that are already saved in the system. It take input images
                 from the captured images directory and makes predictoins on them.
   
   3. To run the code - 
      3.1 - Open Jupyter Notebook
      3.2 - Run any of the code in the Code to test the models directory
      3.3 - Give input and get the predictions.
